Use `BEGIN TRANSACTION` to start a transaction in Microsoft SQL Server. Ensure data consistency by committing changes with `COMMIT` or rolling back with `ROLLBACK` in case of issues.

## MySQL

### Tutorial
- [How to Use MySQL Transactions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-mysql-transactions/)
